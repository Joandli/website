    Equipped with various tools and machines for working with wood, metal or
    other materials, it is the perfect mobile hub for artisans and makers, so
    they can maintain and repair local infrastructure and find alternatives for
    missing parts. A Tolocar also creates space for **shared learning, community

          When faced with challenges or adversity way beyond what a person can handle - one of the cultural responses in Ukraine is "Toloka".

          **Turning to the crowd for support. Providing solutions at the needed scale, and with ingenuity and insight beyond what an individual can muster.**

          In Germany a cultural memory of support and shared purpose beyond traditional perspectives and means is the Berlin air bridge.

          This means **they bring the capacity of high end manufacturing or diagnosis technologies to the point of need.** 

          But crucially they remain plugged into a world wide community of diverse domain experts who can bring their collective intelligence to bear in ways that complement conventional relief or rebuilding efforts.
        </div>
        <div class="flex-1">
          The aim is to enable communities to replicate some of the capabilities and so to catalyze rebuilding efforts and establish support networks.  

          Beyond the technical capability this provides the Tolocars with the agility, diversity of perspective, and capacity to absorb feedback directly from the user's context. 

          All this enables highly reactive user centered designs, short feedback loops, and disintermediation, and adapting products and services to complex and changing environments.

          This community is generally highly networked and very effective in matching problems with persons able to contribute parts of a solution. This is particularly common in the highly collaborative open source hard- and software movements. 
        </div>
        <div class="flex-1">
          ​These networked communities are sometimes able to frame a personal or general problem very differently and so avoid or solve it very resource efficiently. 

          Such user driven innovation can lead to highly specialized solutions that aren’t reliably served by mass markets. However today some open source hardware competes with well established mass market products.
