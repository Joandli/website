    Equipped with various tools and machines for working with wood, metal or
    other materials, it is the perfect mobile hub for artisans and makers, so
    they can maintain and repair local infrastructure and find alternatives for
    missing parts. A Tolocar also creates space for **shared learning, community engagement, connection and discourse.**
